<span class="i0">Its nudity had startled me;<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Bill, I feel far from quite right&mdash;if not further: already the pill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seems, if I may say so, to bubble inside me. A poet's heart, Bill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is a sort of a thing that is made of the tenderest young bloom on a fruit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may pass me the mixture at once, if you please&mdash;and I'll thank you to boot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that poem&mdash;and then for the julep. This really is damnable stuff!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Not the poem, of course.) Do you snivel, old friend? well, it's nasty enough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I think I can stand it&mdash;I think so&mdash;ay, Bill, and I could were it worse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I'll tell you a thing that I can't and I won't. 'Tis the old, old curse&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gall of the gold-fruited Eden, the lure of the angels that fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis the core of the fruit snake-spotted in the hush of the shadows of hell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where a lost man sits with his head drawn down, and a weight on his eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know what I mean, Bill&mdash;the tender and delicate mother of lies,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woman, the devil's first cousin&mdash;no doubt by the female side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breath of her mouth still moves in my hair, and I know that she lied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I feel her, Bill, sir, inside me&mdash;she operates there like a drug.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were it better to live like a beetle, to wear the cast clothes of a slug,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be the louse in the locks of the hangman, the mote in the eye of the bat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to live and believe in a woman, who must one day grow aged and fat?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must see it's preposterous, Bill, sir. And yet, how the thought of it clings!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have lived out my time&mdash;I have prigged lots of verse&mdash;I have kissed (ah, that stings!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lips that swore I had cribbed every line that I wrote on them&mdash;cribbed&mdash;honour bright!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I loathed her; but now I forgive her; perhaps after all she was right.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I swear it was shameful&mdash;unwomanly, Bill, sir&mdash;to say that I fibbed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, the poems were mine, for I bought them in print. Cribbed? of course they were cribbed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I wouldn't say, cribbed from the French&mdash;Lady Bathsheba thought it was vulgar&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But picked up on the banks of the Don, from the lips of a highly intelligent Bulgar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm aware, Bill, that's out of all metre&mdash;I can't help it&mdash;I'm none of your sort<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who set metres, by Jove, above morals&mdash;not exactly. They don't go to Court&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I mentioned one night to that cowslip-faced pet, Lady Rahab Redrabbit</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Whom the Marquis calls Drabby for short). Well, I say, if you want a thing, grab it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's what I did, at least, when I took that <i>danseuse</i> to a swell <i>cabaret</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where expense was no consideration. A poet, you see, now and then must be gay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(I declined to give more, I remember, than fifty centeems to the waiter;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I asked him if that was enough; and the jackanapes answered&mdash;<i>Peut-&ecirc;tre</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, it isn't in you to draw up a <i>menu</i> such as ours was, though humble:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I told Lady Shoreditch, she thought it a regular <i>grand tout ensemble</i>.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She danced the heart out of my body&mdash;I can see in the glare of the lights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can see her again as I saw her that evening, in spangles and tights.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I spoke to her first, her eye flashed so, I heard&mdash;as I fancied&mdash;the spark whiz<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her eyelid&mdash;I said so next day to that jealous old fool of a Marquis.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She reminded me, Bill, of a lovely volcano, whose entrails are lava&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or (you know my <i>penchant</i> for original types) of the upas in Java.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the curve of her sensitive nose was a singular species of dimple,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the flush was the mark of an angel's creased kiss&mdash;if it wasn't a pimple.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now I'm none of your bashful John Bulls who don't know a pilau from a puggaree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor a chili, by George, from a chopstick. So, sir, I marched into her snuggery,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And proposed a light supper by way of a finish. I treated her, Bill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To six <i>entr&eacute;es</i> of ortolans, sprats, maraschino, and oysters. It made her quite ill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of which moment of sickness I took some advantage. I held her like this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And availed myself, sir, of her sneezing, to shut up her lips with a kiss.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waiters, I saw, were quite struck; and I felt, I may say, <i>entre nous</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Don Juan, Lauzun, Almaviva, Lord Byron, and old Richelieu.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(You'll observe, Bill, that rhyme's quite Parisian; a Londoner, sir, would have cited old Q.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">People tell me the French in my verses recalls that of Jeames or John Thomas: I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must maintain it's as good as the average accent of British diplomacy.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are moments that thrill the whole spirit with spasms that excite and exalt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stood more than the peer of the great Casanova&mdash;you know&mdash;de Seingalt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was worth, sir, I say it without hesitation, two brace of her sisters.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, why should all honey turn rhubarb&mdash;all cherries grow onions&mdash;all kisses leave blisters?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, and why should I ask myself questions? I've heard such before&mdash;once or twice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, I can't understand it&mdash;but, O, I imagine it strikes me as nice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's a deity shapes us our ends, sir, rough-hew them, my boy, how we will&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I stated myself in a poem I published last year, you know, Bill&mdash;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Where I mentioned that that was the question&mdash;to be, or, by Jove, not to be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, it's something&mdash;you'll think so hereafter&mdash;to wait on a poet like me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had I written no more than those verses on that Countess I used to call Pussy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, Minette or Manon&mdash;and&mdash;you'll hardly believe it&mdash;she said they were all out of Musset.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now I don't say they weren't&mdash;but what then? and I don't say they were&mdash;I'll bet pounds against pennies on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The subject&mdash;I wish I may never die Laureate, if some of them weren't out of Tennyson.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I think&mdash;I don't like to be certain, with Death, so to speak, by me, frowning&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I think there were some&mdash;say a dozen, perhaps, or a score&mdash;out of Browning.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And&mdash;though God knows his poems are not (as all mine are, sir) perfumed with orris&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or at least with patchouli&mdash;I wouldn't be sworn there were none out of Morris.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it's possible&mdash;only the legend of Circe is quite an old yarn&mdash;old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the hills&mdash;that I might have been thinking, perhaps, of a poem by Arnold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I sang how Ulysses&mdash;Odysseus I mean&mdash;would have yearned to dishevel her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright hair with his kisses, and painted myself at her feet&mdash;a Strayed Reveller.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for poets who go on a contrary tack to what I go and you go&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You remember my lyrics <i>translated</i>&mdash;like "sweet bully Bottom"&mdash;from Hugo?</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I will say it's curious that simply on just that account there should be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men so bold as to say that not one of my poems was written by me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It would stir the political bile or the physical spleen of a drab or a Tory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear critics disputing my claim to Empedocles, Maud, and the Laboratory.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, it's singular&mdash;nay, I can't think of a parallel (ain't it a high lark?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As that Countess would say)&mdash;there are few men believe it was I wrote the Ode to a Skylark.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it often has given myself and Lord Albert no end of diversion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear fellows maintain to my face it was Wordsworth who wrote the Excursion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they know that whole reams of the verses recur in my authorized works<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here and there, up and down! Why, such readers are infidels&mdash;heretics&mdash;Turks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pitiful critics who think in their paltry presumption to pay me a<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pretty compliment, pairing me off, sir, with Keats&mdash;as if <i>he</i> could write Lamia!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I never produced a more characteristic and exquisite book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One that gave me more real satisfaction, than did, on the whole, Lalla Rookh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was it there that I called on all debtors, being pestered myself by a creditor, (he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Isn't paid yet) to rise, by the proud appellation of bondsmen&mdash;hereditary?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes&mdash;I think so. And yet, on my word, I can't think why I think it was so.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It more probably was in the poem I made a few seasons ago<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On that Duchess&mdash;her name now? ah, thus one outlives a whole cycle of joys!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair supplants black and brown succeeds golden. The poem made rather a noise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And indeed I have seen worse verses; but as for the woman, my friend&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though his neck had been never so stiff, she'd have made a philosopher bend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the broken heart of a sunset that bleeds pure purple and gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the shudder and swoon of the sickness of colour, the agonies old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That engirdle the brows of the day when he sinks with a spasm into rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the splash of his kingly blood is dashed on the skirts of the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even such was my own, when I felt how much sharper than any snake's tooth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was the passion that made me mistake Lady Eve for her niece Lady Ruth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whole world, colourless, lapsed. Earth fled from my feet like a dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the whirl of the walls of Space was about me, and moved as a stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flowing and ebbing and flowing all night to a weary tune<br /></span>
<span class="i0">("Such as that of my verses"? Get out!) in the face of a sick-souled moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The keen stars kindled and faded and fled, and the wind in my ears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was the wail of a poet for failure&mdash;you needn't come snivelling tears</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[Pg 413]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spoiling the mixture, confound you, with dropping your tears into that!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know I'm pathetic&mdash;I must be&mdash;and you soft-hearted and fat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I'm grateful of course for your kindness&mdash;there, don't come hugging me, now&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But because a fellow's pathetic, you needn't low like a cow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I should like&mdash;on my soul, I should like&mdash;to remember&mdash;but somehow I can't&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the lady whose love has reduced me to this was the niece or the aunt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whichever it was, I feel sure, when I published my lays of last year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(You remember their title&mdash;The Tramp&mdash;only seven-and-sixpence&mdash;not dear),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sent her a copy (perhaps her tears fell on the title-page&mdash;yes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should like to imagine she wept)&mdash;and the Bride of Bulgaria (MS.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I forwarded with it. The lyrics, no doubt, she found bitter&mdash;and sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the Bride she rejected, you know, with expressions I will not repeat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well&mdash;she did no more than all publishers did. Though my prospects were marred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can pity and pardon them. Blindness, mere blindness! And yet it was hard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a poet, Bill, is a blossom&mdash;a bird&mdash;a billow&mdash;a breeze&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A kind of creature that moves among men as a wind among trees.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a bard who is also the pet of patricians and dowagers doubly can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Express his contempt for canaille in his fables where beasts are republican.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet with all my disdainful forgiveness for men so deficient in <i>ton</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot but feel it was cruel&mdash;I cannot but think it was wrong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I with the heat of my heart still burning against all bars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the fire of the dawn, so to speak, in the blanched blank brows of the stars&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I with my tremulous lips made pale by musical breath&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I with the shade in my eyes that was left by the kisses of Death&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For Death came near me in youth, and touched my face with his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put in my lips the songs that belong to a desolate place&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Desolate truly, my heart and my lips, till her kiss filled them up!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I with my soul like wine poured out with my flesh for the cup&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was hard for me&mdash;it was hard&mdash;Bill, Bill, you great owl, was it not?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the day creeps in like a Fate: and I think my grand passion is rot:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I dreamily seem to perceive, by the light of a life's dream done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lotion at six, and the mixture at ten, and the draught before one.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yes&mdash;I feel rather better. Man's life is a mull, at the best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the patent perturbator pills are like bullets of lead in my chest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When a man's whole spirit is like the lost Pleiad, a blown-out star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is there comfort in Holloway, Bill? is there hope of salvation in Parr?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True, most things work to their end&mdash;and an end that the shroud overlaps.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under lace, under silk, under gold, sir, the skirt of a winding-sheet flaps&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which explains, if you think of it, Bill, why I can't, though my soul thereon broodeth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quite make out if I loved Lady Tamar as much as I loved Lady Judith.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet her dress was of violet velvet, her hair was hyacinth-hued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her ankles&mdash;no matter. A face where the music of every mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was touched by the tremulous fingers of passionate feeling, and made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange melodies, scornful, but sweeter than strings whereon sorrow has played<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To enrapture the hearing of mirth when his garland of blossom and green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns to lead on the anguished forehead&mdash;"you don't understand what I mean"?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, of course I knew you were stupid&mdash;you always were stupid at school&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now don't say you weren't&mdash;but I'm hanged if I thought you were quite such a fool!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You don't see the point of all this? I was talking of sickness and death&mdash;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In that poem I made years ago, I said this&mdash;"Love, the flower-time whose breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smells sweet through a summer of kisses and perfumes an autumn of tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is sadder at root than a winter&mdash;its hopes heavy-hearted like fears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I love your Grace more than I love little Letty, the maid of the mill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the heat of your lips when I kiss them" (you see we were intimate, Bill)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And the beat of the delicate blood in your eyelids of azure and white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave the taste of the grave in my mouth and the shadow of death on my sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fill the cup&mdash;twine the chaplet&mdash;come into the garden&mdash;get out of the house&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drink to <i>me</i> with your eyes&mdash;there's a banquet behind, where worms only carouse!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I said to sweet Katie, who lived by the brook on the land Philip farmed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worms shall graze where my kisses found pasture!" The Duchess, I may say, was charmed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was read to the Duke, and he cried like a child. If you'll give me a pill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll go on till past midnight. That poem was said to be&mdash;Somebody's, Bill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you see you can always be sure of my hand as the mother that bore me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the fact that I never write verse which has never been written before me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Other poets&mdash;I blush for them, Bill&mdash;may adore and repudiate in turn a<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Libitina, perhaps, or Pandemos; my Venus, you know, is Laverna.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, that epic of mine which begins from foundations the Bible is built on&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Of man's <i>first</i> disobedience"&mdash;I've heard it attributed, dammy, to Milton.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, it's lucky for them that it's not worth my while, as I may say, to break spears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the hirelings, forsooth, of the press who assert that Othello was Shakespeare's.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he that can run, sir, may read&mdash;if he borrows the book, or goes on tick&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In my poems the bit that describes how the Hellespont joins the Propontic.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are men, I believe, who will tell you that Gray wrote the whole of The Bard&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or that I didn't write half the Elegy, Bill, in a Country Churchyard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When you know that my poem, The Poet, begins&mdash;"Ruin seize thee!" and ends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With recapitulations of horrors the poet invokes on his friends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I'll swear, if you look at the dirge on my relatives under the turf, you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will perceive it winds up with some lines on myself&mdash;and begins with the curfew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now you'll grant it's more probable, Bill&mdash;as a man of the world, if you please&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all these should have prigged from myself than that I should have prigged from all these.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could cry when I think of it, friend, if such tears would comport with my dignity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the author of Christabel ever should smart from such vulgar malignity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(You remember perhaps that was one of the first little things that I carolled</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">After finishing Marmion, the Princess, the Song of the Shirt, and Childe Harold.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, doubtless it always has been so&mdash;Ah, doubtless it always will be&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are men who would say that myself is a different person from me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better the porridge of patience a poor man snuffs in his plate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the water of poisonous laurels distilled by the fingers of hate.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Tis a dark-purple sort of a moonlighted kind of a midnight, I know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You remember those verses I wrote on Irene, from Edgar A. Poe?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was Lady Aholibah Levison, daughter of old Lord St. Giles,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who inspired those delectable strains, and rewarded her bard with her smiles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are tasters who've sipped of Castalia, who don't look on <i>my</i> brew as <i>the</i> brew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are fools who can't think why the names of my heroines of title should always be Hebrew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas my comrade, Sir Alister Knox, said, "Noo, dinna ye fash wi' Apollo, mon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gang to Jewry for wives and for concubines, lad&mdash;look at David and Solomon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it gives an erotico-scriptural twang," said that high-born young man, "&mdash;tickles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lug" (he meant ear) "of the reader&mdash;to throw in a touch of the Canticles."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I versified half of The Preacher&mdash;it took me a week, working slowly. Bah!</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">You don't half know the sex, Bill&mdash;they like it. And what if her name was Aholibah?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I recited her charms, in conjunction with those of a girl at the <i>caf&eacute;</i>,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a poem I published in collaboration with Templeton (Taffy).<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are prudes in a world full of envy&mdash;and some of them thought it too strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To compare an earl's daughter by name with a girl at a French <i>restaurant</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I regarded her, though, with the chivalrous eyes of a knight-errant on quest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I may say I don't know that I ever felt prouder, old friend, of a conquest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when <i>I</i>'ve been made happy, I never have cared a brass farthing who knew it; I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thank my stars I'm as free from mock-modesty, friend, as from vulgar fatuity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I can't say if my spirit retains&mdash;for the subject appears to me misty&mdash;any tie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To such associations as Poesy weaves round the records of Christianity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are bards&mdash;I may be one myself&mdash;who delight in their skill to unlock a lip's<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rosy secrets by kisses and whispers of texts from the charming Apocalypse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was thus that I won, by such biblical pills of poetical manna,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From two elders&mdash;Sir Seth and Lord Isaac&mdash;the liking of Lady Susanna.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I left her&mdash;a woman to me is no more than a match, sir, at tennis is&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I heard she'd gone off with my valet, and burnt my rhymed version of Genesis.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">You may see by my shortness of speech that my time's almost up: I perceive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That my new-fangled brevity strikes you: but don't&mdash;though the public will&mdash;grieve.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it's sometimes my whim to be vulgar, it's sometimes my whim to be brief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when once I observed, after Heine, that "she was a harlot, and I" (which is true) "was a thief."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Though you hardly should cite this particular line, by the way, as an instance of absolute brevity:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm aware, man, of that; so you needn't disgrace yourself, sir, by such grossly mistimed and impertinent levity.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I don't like to break off, any more than you wish me to stop: but my fate is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to vent half a million such rhymes without blockheads exclaiming&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Are they looks of our lovers that lustrously lean from a marvel of mystic miraculous moonshine,<br /></span>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
